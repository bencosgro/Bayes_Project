# Bayes_Project_Jupyter_Final.ipynb
The attached file can be run as a jupyter notebook file. The file begins by pulling the dataset which can be obtained at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/breast-cancer-wisconsin/ and downloaded as wdbc.names for the columns and wdbc.data for the data.  Remember to put this file in the same folder as the data. From there you can run all cells. This will take up to 10 minutes to run all the regressions.
